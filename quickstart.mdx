### Install the Pickaxe CLI

The Pickaxe CLI is a command line interface for quickly getting started with Pickaxe by scaffolding a new agent project:

```sh
pnpm i -g @hatchet-dev/pickaxe-cli
pickaxe create my-agent
cd my-agent
```

### Generate a Hatchet API token

Pickaxe requires a [Hatchet](https://hatchet.run) API token for orchestration. You can generate a Hatchet token by signing up for a free account on [Hatchet Cloud](https://cloud.onhatchet.run) or following instructions for [self-hosting Hatchet](https://docs.hatchet.run/self-hosting).

Set the API token in your environment:

```sh
export HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN=<my-token>
```

### Set your LLM API key

Set your LLM API key in your environment:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

### Run your agent

The default pickaxe agent is a simple deep research agent that can be triggered to perform a deep research task. It uses the OpenAI API to generate responses and the Hatchet API to orchestrate the agent's execution. For a full walkthrough of this agent, see the [deep research example](./examples/deep-research).

To start your agent, you can run the following:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

To trigger the agent, you can run:

```sh
pnpm run trigger
```

This will prompt you for a deep research prompt and then execute the agent.
