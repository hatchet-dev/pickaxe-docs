Pickaxe is a library for building fault-tolerant agents, built on top of [Hatchet](https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet). It handles the complexies of durable execution, queueing and scheduling so you can focus on building your application.

Pickaxe agents are:

- **💻 Code-first** - agents are defined as code and are designed to integrate with your business logic.
- **🌐 Distributed** - all agents and tools run across a fleet of machines, where scheduling is handled gracefully by Pickaxe. When your underlying machine fails, Pickaxe takes care of rescheduling and resuming the agent on a different machine.
- **⚙️ Configurable** - simple configuration for retries, rate limiting, concurrency control, and much more
- **☁️ Runnable anywhere** - Pickaxe agents can run on any container-based platform (Railway, Fly.io, Porter, Kubernetes, AWS ECS, GCP Cloud Run)

## Get started

See the [quickstart documentation](./quickstart).

## Concepts

- [**Agents**](./concepts/agents) - an agent is simply a loop that calls **tools**
- [**Toolbox**](./concepts/toolbox) - a collection of tools that are available to an agent
- [**Tools**](./concepts/tools) - a tool is a function available to an agent. A tool can call other tools, agents, or other functions.
