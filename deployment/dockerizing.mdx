Pickaxe is designed to easily be run in any container-based platform ([Hatchet Cloud](https://docs.hatchet.run/home/compute), [Railway](https://railway.app), [Fly.io](https://fly.io), [Porter](https://porter.run), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs), [GCP Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)).

This guide explains how to create Dockerfiles for Pickaxe applications.

## Entrypoint Configuration for Pickaxe

Before creating your Dockerfile, understand that Pickaxe agents require specific entry point configuration:

1. The entry point must run code that runs the Pickaxe agent. This can be done by calling the `pickaxe.start()` method in your respective SDK.
2. Proper environment variables must be set for Pickaxe SDK. At a minimum, you will need to set the `HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN` environment variables.

## Example Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:22 AS builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY package\*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production
FROM node:22-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package\*.json ./

RUN npm install --omit=dev

COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

ENV NODE_ENV=production

CMD ["node", "dist/main.js"]
```
