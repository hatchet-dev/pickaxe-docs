# Creating an Agent

If you ever run into issues or need more information while creating a Pickaxe agent, you can query https://pickaxe.hatchet.run/llms.txt for a full list of documentation pages available, which will help you understand the concepts and best practices for creating agents.

## Step 1: Planning

Before creating an agent, you will need to figure out the agent's name and function, along with any tools it will use. Typically, existing agents can be found in `./src/agents` and existing tools can be found in `./src/tools`. A typical project structure is:

```txt
my-app/
├── src/
│   ├── agents/
│   │   ├── simple.agent.ts
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── tools/
│   │   ├── simple.tool.ts
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── main.ts
│   ├── pickaxe.client.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

If you are not in a Typescript project already, you should initialize a new Typescript project and use that as the working directory.

If the `./src/agents` directory or the `./src/tools` directory does not exist, you can temporarily create it in order to scaffold the agent and tools using the `scaffold_agent` and `scaffold_tool` commands. If the codebase has a different convention for the file structure, you can copy the created files to the appropriate locations after scaffolding.

## Step 2: Creating Tools

After figuring out the list of tools and agents you want to use, you should start by creating new tools and implement their business logic, or modifying existing tools. To create a tool, you can use the Pickaxe MCP tool called `scaffold_tool`, which creates the boilerplate for a new tool in the `./src/tools` directory.

This does not implement the tool logic itself, but it sets up the basic structure for the tool, including the input and output schemas, and a placeholder function where you can implement the tool logic. **You should implement the tool logic in the newly created tool file.**

After tools have been created, make sure that they are resilient to failure and are set up to retry if they fail. Make special note of the execution and scheduling timeouts. If a tool takes a long time to execute, you may want to increase the timeout to avoid the tool being killed prematurely. The default timeout is 60 seconds.

Tools should be idempotent, meaning that there should not be unexpected side effects if a tool is called multiple times with the same input. This is important for ensuring that tools can be retried without causing issues.

Make sure that tools are thoroughly tested using the user's existing testing framework. It is very important that tools are reliable so that the agent can be reliable.

## Step 3: Creating an Agent

To create an agent, you should first use the Pickaxe MCP tool called `scaffold_agent`. This creates the boilerplate for a new agent with a specified name and description in the `./src/agents` directory, but importantly, this does not implement the agent logic itself. You can run the command as follows:

You will need to implement the agent logic in the newly created agent file. The agent should call the tools you created in Step 2, and should follow the best practices for agents outlined in the documentation.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, the agent should be stateless and have no side effects. This means that the agent should not maintain any internal state between calls, and its output should be solely determined by the input it receives and the tools it calls. The agent should only call methods which have been documented in the Pickaxe documentation as durable, such as `waitFor`, `run`, and `runNoWait`.
