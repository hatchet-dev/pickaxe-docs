When developing Pickaxe agents, it's recommended to use the Pickaxe MCP server for local development. This allows for fast scaffolding of agents and tools, and provides instructions with best practices for agent development.

# Pickaxe MCP Server

The Pickaxe CLI comes bundled with a local MCP server which runs on a `stdio` connection for development. This enables AI development tools to interact with your Pickaxe project programmatically. Make sure you have installed the Pickaxe CLI globally:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm i -g @hatchet-dev/pickaxe-cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm i -g @hatchet-dev/pickaxe-cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn global add @hatchet-dev/pickaxe-cli
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Quick Setup

The basic Pickaxe MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pickaxe": {
      "command": "pickaxe",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment Configuration

### Cursor

Create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pickaxe": {
      "command": "pickaxe",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code

Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pickaxe": {
      "command": "pickaxe",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

Create a `.mcp.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pickaxe": {
      "command": "pickaxe",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, configure via the Claude Code CLI:

```bash
claude-code config mcp add pickaxe "pickaxe mcp"
```

### Other AI Tools

For tools that support MCP, place the configuration in their designated MCP configuration file location. The standard configuration format remains:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pickaxe": {
      "command": "pickaxe",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Working Directory

Specify a custom working directory:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pickaxe": {
      "command": "pickaxe",
      "args": ["mcp", "--cwd", "/path/to/your/pickaxe/project"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**MCP server not starting**: Ensure Pickaxe CLI is installed and accessible:

```bash
pickaxe --version
```

**Permission errors**: Check that the Pickaxe CLI has execution permissions and the project directory is accessible.

**Connection failures**: Verify the configuration file is in the correct location for your environment and follows the proper JSON format.

# Using the CLI

You can also use the Pickaxe CLI for development using the `pickaxe add` commands. These commands generate the boilerplate for agents and tools in a default Pickaxe project structure. You can also use these as a starting point for agents in your own project.

## Creating an Agent

You can scaffold a new agent using the `pickaxe add agent` command. This command creates a new agent with the specified name and model, and generates the boilerplate code for the agent in the `./src/agents` directory.

```sh
pickaxe add agent my-agent --model gpt-4
```

## Creating a Tool

You can scaffold a new tool using the `pickaxe add tool` command. This command creates a new tool with the specified name and category, and generates the boilerplate code for the tool in the `./src/tools` directory.

```sh
pickaxe add tool my-tool
```
