In Pickaxe, a tool is a function that performs a specific task and can be called by agents. Tools handle the actual work while agents orchestrate their execution.

# Creating a Tool

To create a tool, define the input and output schemas using [Zod](https://zod.dev/). Each Zod field should include a description to improve LLM tool selection when used in a [toolbox](./toolbox).

```ts
import z from "zod";

const MyToolInput = z.object({
  message: z.string().describe("The message to process"),
});

const MyToolOutput = z.object({
  result: z.string().describe("The processed result"),
});
```

Create the tool using the [`pickaxe.tool`](/api-reference/tool) method:

```ts
export const myTool = pickaxe.tool({
  name: "my-tool",
  description: "Processes messages and returns results",
  inputSchema: MyToolInput,
  outputSchema: MyToolOutput,
  fn: async (input) => {
    // Tool logic here - API calls, data processing, etc.
    return {
      result: `Processed: ${input.message}`,
    };
  },
});
```

Tools can perform side effects like API calls, database operations, or file system access. Unlike agents, tools are designed to do the actual work and can maintain state as needed.

# Running a Tool

Tools can be executed directly using several methods. The most common is `run`, which executes the tool and waits for completion:

```ts
const result = await myTool.run({
  message: "Hello, world!",
});

console.log(result.result); // "Processed: Hello, world!"
```

For fire-and-forget scenarios, use `runNoWait` to trigger execution without waiting:

```ts
const runRef = await myTool.runNoWait({
  message: "Background task",
});

console.log(`Started run: ${runRef.workflowRunId}`);
```

Tools can also be scheduled to run at specific times or on recurring schedules:

```ts
// Schedule to run at a specific time
const scheduledRun = await myTool.schedule(new Date("2024-12-25T09:00:00Z"), {
  message: "Christmas task",
});

// Schedule with a delay
const delayedRun = await myTool.delay(
  300, // 300 seconds = 5 minutes
  { message: "Delayed task" }
);

// Set up recurring cron schedule
const cronRun = await myTool.cron(
  "daily-cleanup",
  "0 2 * * *", // Every day at 2 AM
  { message: "Daily cleanup task" }
);
```

# Using Tools in Agents

Tools are typically called from within agents using the tool's `run` method:

```ts
export const myAgent = pickaxe.agent({
  name: "my-agent",
  inputSchema: z.object({ message: z.string() }),
  outputSchema: z.object({ response: z.string() }),
  fn: async (input, ctx) => {
    const { result } = await myTool.run({
      message: input.message,
    });

    return {
      response: result,
    };
  },
});
```

This approach allows agents to orchestrate tool execution while maintaining durability and fault tolerance.
