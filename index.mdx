Pickaxe is a library for building effective agents, built on top of [Hatchet](https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet). Pickaxe agents are:

- **Durable by default** - all tools called by the agent are sent through a durable message boundary
- **Distributed by default** - all agents and tools run across a fleet of machines, where scheduling is handled gracefully by Hatchet
- **Agnostic to execution pattern** - Pickaxe agents can be written as loops, scatter/gather workflows, or directed acyclic graphs
- **Simple to scale** - Pickaxe agents allow simple configuration for retries, rate limiting, concurrency control, and much more

## Get started

See the [quickstart documentation](./quickstart).

## Concepts

- [**Agents**](./concepts/agents) - an agent is simply a loop that calls **tools**
- [**Toolbox**](./concepts/toolbox) - a collection of tools that are available to an agent
- [**Tools**](./concepts/tools) - a tool is a function available to an agent. A tool can call other tools, agents, or other functions.
